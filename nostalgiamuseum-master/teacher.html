                        With the earliest recorded existence of these tools being in the age of the Mesopotamians, the abacus is the original form of the calculator.

                        By using this teacher are able to teach students from remotely (different states) while providing PowerPoint, lectures, study guides and assignments all online. This has aided teachers in teaching in this new format as well as making it so much easier to prep for classes and stay organized. This also has helped teachers grade assignments, projects more efficiently and easily. The first instance of distance learning recorded was in 1728, when Caleb Phillips offered private courses on short hand writing  in Boston, Massachusetts. These courses would be taught through sending letters back and forth.

                    This is an interactive textbook that teachers can use for a more personalized approach to teaching, as it provides interactive lessons, readings, support, training and more, which students can use to help them learn. One of the first ebooks was made by Angela Ruiz Robles who used a machine that ran on compressed air  which turned spools as the student read. She made this hoping it would help her students through reducing the number of textbooks they had to carry. It was never mass produced, but a prototype of it still exists at the National Museum of Science and Technology in La Coruno, Spain.

                            Teachers use this interactive presentation tool, to convert lessons plans into dynamic interactive classrooms. Teachers can write on screens as well as project the lessons onto multiple screens, eliminating the need for blackboard. This allows teachers to digitally mark up and annotate directly on their lessons, and even dive into key concepts with in real time visual aids. Ultimately, it helps teachers more effectively engage with their students.
